# stats_project-A-B-Test-
In this project, I performed an exploratory data analysis on an e-commerce dataset to understand customer behavior, product trends, and shipping efficiency.


## A/B Testing: Effect of Shipping Speed on Customer Satisfaction
Hypothesis:

- H0: There is no difference in satisfaction between standard and fast shipping.

- H1: Fast shipping leads to higher satisfaction.

- Merged review data with shipping data.

- Calculated average review scores for each shipping category.

- Checked for normality (Anderson-Darling test showed non-normal distribution).

- Applied Mann-Whitney U Test (non-parametric):

- Result: Statistically significant difference (p < 0.05)

- Conclusion: Fast shipping results in significantly higher customer satisfaction.

## 📁 Dataset  
- Source: [Olist Brazilian E-commerce Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)  
- Contains 100k+ orders from multiple marketplaces in Brazil

- Developed during the **Le Wagon Data Analytics Bootcamp**, this end-to-end analysis combines data wrangling, visualization, and business intelligence tools to tell a story with data.
